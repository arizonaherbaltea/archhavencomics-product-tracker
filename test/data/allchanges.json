Roland and Maggie Kane are more fortunate than most, because\ntheir father, Daniel, is a Chicago cop who has taught them how to shoot\nand prepared them for almost every eventuality. But, as the Kane family\nsoon learns, there is just no way to prepare for an alien invasion.\n\nHowever, Roland also discovers that although the Darksiders’ blood may\nbe green, the invaders will die as readily as any man after being\nventilated with enough high-speed projectiles.\n\nRod Walker is the New New Heinlein, and The Thousand Worlds marks the\nreturn of science fiction to its classical form and historical heights.\nWritten in the style and tradition of Robert Heinlein’s 12 classic\njuvenile novels published by Scribner, YOUNG MAN’S WAR is an exciting\ntale of survival, courage, independence, and the indomitable spirit of\nMan."},"to":{}}
