    \ by the author of the *Maneuver Warfare Handbook* and an\nactive-duty USMC officer\

    \n***A History of Strategy: From Sun Tzu to William S. Lind***\n\nMartin van Creveld\n\
    \n144 pages\n\n“Martin van Creveld ranks high among military historians, and given\
    \ the\nchanges in technology since Napoleonic times, his work is a necessary\n\
    supplement to Clausewitz.”\n\n– Dr. Jerry Pournelle\n\n*The Art of War* by Sun\
    \ Tzu and *On War* by Carl von Clausewitz are\nknown to everyone who studies war.\
    \ But in the approximately 2,327 years\nthat separated Man’s two most famous works\
    \ of military tactics and\nstrategy, a considerable number of less well-known\
    \ works were published.\nSome, such as those written by Vauban and Douhet, were\
    \ focused on\nspecific aspects of war, while others like Onasander and Jomini\
    \ wrote\nworks that were more general in nature. But all of them were written\n\
    with the objective of permitting generals and other leaders of men to\nwage war\
    \ more effectively.\n\nThere are few better suited to write the history of strategy\
    \ and\nmilitary thought than Dr. Martin van Creveld, who has himself been a\n\
    significant contributor to the literature of war. A Professor Emeritus\nat the\
    \ Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Dr. van Creveld is one of the\nworld’s leading\
    \ writers on military history and strategy, with a special\ninterest in the future\
    \ of war. He is fluent in Hebrew, German, Dutch,\nand English, and has authored\
    \ more than twenty books, including the\ninfluential *Technology and War: 2000\
    \ BC to the Present* (1988), *The\nTransformation of War* (1991), and *The Culture\
    \ of War* (2010). He is\nknown for his development of the concept of “nontrinitarian”\
    \ warfare as\nwell as contributing two books to the 4GW canon.\n\nFeaturing a\
    \ foreword by Dr. Jerry Pournelle, *A History of Strategy:\nFrom Sun Tzu to William\
    \ S. Lind* begins with the Chinese military\nliterature, then reviews the Greek,\
    \ Roman and Byzantine works before\nproceeding to the Middle Ages. From Machiavelli\
    \ and Montecuccoli to\nGuibert and Frederick the Great, van Creveld chronicles\
    \ the gradual\ntransition from medieval to Napoleonic warfare. Subsequent chapters\n\
    delve into the literature of naval warfare, including Mahan and Corbett,\nthen\
    \ examine the works of the leading strategists of the early 20th\ncentury, including\
    \ Moltke, Liddell Hart, and Ludendorff. The final\nchapter considers the modern\
    \ strategists behind such concepts as\nMutually Assured Destruction, terrorism,\
    \ insurgency, and 4th Generation\nWar.\n\nThis brief, but wide-ranging history\
    \ is an effective education in\nmilitary thought. It is an excellent introduction\
    \ to the various\nstrategic works for the neophyte, and an illuminating summary\
    \ of them\nfor armchair and professional experts alike. Van Creveld not only\n\
    describes each thinker and his most important contributions, but\nexplains how\
    \ one conceptual advancement led to another, and in doing so,\nmakes it eminently\
    \ clear why Sun Tzu and Clausewitz are so universally\nwell-regarded by theoreticians\
    \ and practitioners of war alike."

    ***A Sea of Skulls (Arts of Dark and Light Book Two)***


    Vox Day


    429 pages


    In Selenoth, the war drums are beating throughout the land. The savage

    orcs of Hagahorn and Zoth Ommog are on the move, imperiling Man, Dwarf,

    and Elf alike. The Houses Martial of Amorr have gone to war with each

    other, pitting legion against legion, and family against family, as

    civil war wracks the disintegrating Empire. In the north, inhuman

    wolf-demons besiege the last redoubt of Man in the White Sea, while in

    Savondir, the royal house of de Mirid desperately prepares to defend the

    kingdom against an invading army that is larger than any it has ever

    faced before. And in the underground realm of the King of Iron Mountain,

    a strange new enemy has been attacking dwarf villages throughout the

    Underdeep.


    Beneath the widespread violence that has seized all Selenoth in its

    grasp, a select few are beginning to recognize the appearance of a

    historic pattern of almost unimaginable proportions. Are all these

    conflicts involving Orc, Elf, Man, and Dwarf the natural result of

    inevitable rivalries, or are they little more than battlegrounds in an

    ancient war that began long before the dawn of time?


    The 2017 Dragon Award Finalist for Best Fantasy Novel. Epic fantasy at

    its deepest and most intense. A SEA OF SKULLS is Book Two in the ARTS OF

    DARK AND LIGHT series that began with A THRONE OF BONES.'

    ***Alien Game (The Thousand Worlds)***


    Rod Walker


    233 pages


    With nothing to do but work or lose himself in the dubious digital

    pleasures of the Netrix, Sam Hammond finds himself bored beyond belief

    on the oppressive planet of New Princeton. And when he gets himself in

    trouble for a stupid act of vandalism, he has the choice of spending a

    year in prison or working off his time as an indentured servant for

    anyone who buys his contract.


    He might have chosen the prison if he’d known that he’d find himself

    working security for a safari colony on a jungle world where the

    herbivores are the size of a stadium, the apex predators are vicious

    lizards that can turn themselves almost invisible, and the skies are

    filled with huge, acid-breathing fliers. And when New Princeton’s

    Minister of Ecology arrives for a visit with a spaceship full of wealthy

    and powerful guests, Sam discovers that Man is the most dangerous animal

    on the planet.


    Rod Walker is the New New Heinlein, and The Thousand Worlds marks the

    return of science fiction to its classical form and historical heights.

    Written in the style and tradition of Robert Heinlein’s 12 classic

    juvenile novels published by Scribner, ALIEN GAME is an exciting tale of

    space, adventure, courage, independence, and the indomitable spirit of

    Man.'

    **An Equation of Almost Infinite Complexity**


    J. Mulrooney


    When the devil moves in next door to Cooper Smith Cooper’s house, Cooper

    doesn’t know what to make of him at first. But when the unexpectedly

    neighborly Scratch helps the unemployed actuary find a job at a local

    insurance company with the help of some inside information into the

    activities of Death, Cooper decides the old devil might not be so bad

    after all.


    The only problem, Cooper thinks, is how to conceal from his fellow

    actuaries his newfound ability to perfectly predict the time and place

    of people’s deaths. And then, there is also the small matter of the

    screams of his recently deceased neighbor coming from Scratch’s basement

    furnace to consider.


    AN EQUATION OF ALMOST INFINITE COMPLEXITY is a sardonically funny debut

    novel from J. Mulrooney.'

    ***Between Light and Shadow: An Exploration of the Fiction of Gene

    Wolfe, 1951 to 1986***


    Marc Aramini


    *Between Light and Shadow* is the first volume in a two-volume analysis

    of Gene Wolfe’s literary works and takes a comprehensive look at Wolfe’s

    astonishing body of work from 1951 to 1986. Wolfe is famous for creating

    labyrinthine and complicated stories full of allusions that are not

    always easily understood; Between Light and Shadow explores every short

    story and novel that Wolfe composed in the first half of his career.


    *Between Light and Shadow* is not only a holistic illustration of

    Wolfe’s work, but attempts to solve many of the narrative mysteries that

    have eluded readers for decades. From focused essays interpreting

    masterpieces such as “The Fifth Head of Cerberus” and “Peace” to

    complete story analyses which not only delineate allusions and themes

    ***Beyond Time and Memory: An Exploration of the Fiction of Gene Wolfe,

    1987 to 1990***


    Marc Aramini


    *Beyond Time and Memory* is the second volume in a comprehensive

    analysis of Gene Wolfe’s literary works, presenting the thesis that

    objective closure is possible in even Wolfe’s most complicated

    cosmological and metaphysical narratives and attempting to make the

    mysteries behind the ideas and images ultimately comprehensible.


    This series is not only a holistic illustration of Wolfe’s work, but

    attempts to solve many of the narrative mysteries that have eluded

    readers for decades. Containing focused essays on the novels  and story

    analyses that identify allusions and themes, respecting authorial intent

    and taking a rigorous and logical approach to reading Wolfe, the book is

    part of an enormous commitment to understanding the work of one of

    modern literature’s most unique and challenging figures.


    The novels covered in this volume are *Soldier of the Mist* and *Soldier

    of Arete*, *The Urth of the New Sun*, *There Are Doors*, *Pandora by

    Holly Hollander*, and *Castleview*.  The short stories include the

    surreal “All the Hues of Hell”, “Empires of Foliage and Flower”, the

    exotic “Tale of the Rose and the Nightingale”, the eldritch “Lord of the

    Land”, the apocalyptic “The Haunted Boardinghouse”.   An appendix deals

    with the poetry of Gene Wolfe, collected in *For Rosemary*.'

    \ the race of Man is on the ascendant. The ancient dragons\nsleep. The ghastly\
    \ Witchkings are no more; their evil power destroyed by\nthe courage of Men and\
    \ the fearsome magic of the Elves. The Dwarves have\nretreated to the kingdoms\
    \ of the Underdeep, the trolls hide in their\nmountains, and even the savage orc\
    \ tribes have learned to dread the iron\ndiscipline of Amorr’s mighty legions.\
    \ But after four hundred years of\nmutual suspicion, the rivalry between two of\
    \ the Houses Martial that\nrule the Amorran Senate threatens to turn violent,\
    \ and unrest sparks\nrebellion throughout the imperial provinces. In the north,\
    \ the barbarian\nreavers who have long plagued the coasts of the White Sea unexpectedly\n\
    plead for the royal protection of the King of Savondir, as they flee a\nvicious\
    \ race of wolf-demons who have invaded their islands. And in the\ndistant east,\
    \ the war drums echo throughout the mountains as orcs and\ngoblins gather in vast\
    \ numbers, summoned by their bestial gods.\n\nEpic fantasy at its deepest and\
    \ most gripping. Military fiction at its\nmost fantastic. *A Throne of Bones* is\
    \ Book I in the ARTS OF DARK AND\nLIGHT series.\n\n*Listen to the [extended audio\n\

    \nAWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND is an epic collection of four of John C.\nWright’s brilliant\
    \ forays into the dark fantasy world of William Hope\nHodgson’s 1912 novel, The\
    \ Night Land. Part novel, part anthology, the\nbook consists of four related novellas,\
    \ “Awake in the Night”, “The Cry\nof the Night-Hound”, “Silence of the Night”,\
    \ and “The Last of All Suns”,\nwhich collectively tell the haunting tale of the\
    \ Last Redoubt of Man and\nthe end of the human race. Widely considered to be\
    \ the finest tribute to\nHodgson ever written, the first novella, “Awake in the\
    \ Night”, was\npreviously published in 2004 in The Year’s Best Science Fiction:\n\
    Twenty-First Annual Collection. AWAKE IN THE NIGHT LAND marks the first\ntime\
    \ all four novellas have been gathered into a single volume.\nDRM-free.\n\nJohn\
    \ C. Wright has been described by reviewers as one of the most\nimportant and\
    \ audacious authors in science fiction today. In a poll of\nmore than 1,000 science\
    \ fiction readers, he was named the sixth-greatest\nliving science fiction writer."

    ***CITY BEYOND TIME: Tales of the Fall of Metachronopolis***


    John C. Wright


    Narrated by Jeremy Daw


    6 hours, 45 minutes.


    Metachronopolis is the golden city beyond time. Ruled by the Masters of

    Time, who can travel freely throughout the multitudinous time lines of

    Man’s history, the city is a shining society of heroes and horrors. For

    the arrogant Masters, who steal famous men and women out of the past and

    Time, who can travel freely throughout the multitudinous time lines of

    Man’s history, the city is a shining society of heroes and horrors. For

    the arrogant Masters, who steal famous men and women out of the past and

    bring them to the eternal city for their amusement, are not only beyond

    time, but beyond remorse and retribution too.

    ***Corrosion (The Corroding Empire, Book One)***


    Johan Kalsi


    Narrated by: Jon Mollison


    7 hours 3 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    by Johan Kalsi


    Galactic society is ruled by algorithms. From interstellar travel and

    planetary terraforming to artificial intelligence and agriculture, every

    human endeavor has become completely dependent upon the hypercomplex

    equations that optimize the activities making life possible across

    hundreds of inhabited worlds. Throughout the galaxy, Man has become

    dependent upon the reliable operation of 10 million different automated

    systems.


    And when things begin to go wrong and mysterious accidents begin to

    happen no one has any idea what is happening, except for a sentient

    medical drone and the First Technocrat of Continox. But their ability to

    even begin to try fixing the unthinkably complicated problem of

    galaxy-wide algorithmic decay is made considerably more difficult by the

    fact the former is an outlaw and the latter is facing a death sentence.


    Johan Kalsi is Finland’s hottest science fiction author. An accomplished

    geneticist as well as a 6’3″ ex-Finnish Marine, in *Corrosion*, Kalsi

    shows himself to be more Asimovian than Asimov

    himself. *Corrosion* marks his English-language debut.'

    ***Cuckservative: How “Conservatives” Betrayed America***


    Vox Day


    Narrated by: Thomas Landon


    Forward by: Mike Cernovich


    5 hours 41 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    Fifty years ago, America was lied to and betrayed by its leaders.


    With virtually no debate, Congress passed the most radical change to

    immigration law in American history. Since 1965, America has endured the

    biggest mass migration of people in human history, twice the size of the

    great wave of immigration into the USA between 1870 and 1930. As a

    result, Americans are being displaced in their own land by an ongoing

    invasion that dwarfs Operation Barbarossa, is two orders of magnitude

    larger than the Mongol hordes, and is one thousand times larger than the

    First Crusade.


    America’s so-called conservative leaders and the conservative media have

    joined forces with liberal internationalists in openly celebrating this

    massive invasion, relying on bad theology, outdated economics, and

    historical myths to falsely claim that immigration is a moral

    imperative, an economic necessity, and in the national interest.

    *Cuckservative: How “Conservatives” Betrayed America* is a powerful

    defense of America’s right to exist as a nation by two Native American

    authors, as well as a damning indictment of a conservatism that has

    failed to conserve America’s culture and traditions.


    This powerful and remorseless book addresses the myth of the Melting

    Pot, proves that mass immigration is a net negative for the U.S.

    economy, and exposes the anti-Christian ideology behind the Christian

    establishment’s support for multiculturalism and open borders. It even

    shows how 50 years of immigration have lowered America’s average IQ. The

    authors pull no punches in conclusively demonstrating that it is not

    right, it is not moral, it is not economically beneficial, and it is not

    Constitutional to betray America’s posterity.


    In *Cuckservative*, John Red Eagle and Vox Day warn Americans that if

    they do not defend their culture, their posterity, and their nation,

    they will eventually find themselves on their own Trail of Tears.'

    ***Do We Need God to be Good: An Anthropologist Examines the Evidence***


    Dr. Christopher Hallpike


    Narrated by: Jon Mollison


    Forward by: Dr. Sarah Salviander


    7 hours 27 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    To know how to live, do we need God and religion, or does religion only

    produce wars, hatred, intolerance, and unhappiness?


    Does giving up God mean giving up morality, or can we finally live a

    peaceful and fulfilling life as atheists by following science and reason

    instead?


    Anthropologist Christopher Hallpike has spent a lifetime’s research on

    the morality and religion of different cultures around the world and

    shows that trying to base a moral life on atheism and science actually

    has some very nasty surprises in store for us. Featuring a Foreword by

    astrophysicist Dr. Sarah Salviander.'

    \n***Equality: The Impossible Quest***\n\nMartin van Creveld\n\n364 pages\n\n\
    All over the Western world gaps between rich and poor are widening—or\nthe headlines\
    \ say. Nobody has done more to spread this view than the\nFrench economic historian\
    \ Thomas Piketty, whose best-selling volume,\nCapital in the Twentieth Century,\
    \ not only documents the process but\nrepresents one long call for reducing the\
    \ gaps so as to create a more\nequal society. But what is equality? Who invented\
    \ the idea, when, where,\nand why? How did it develop, grow, mature, and interact\
    \ with other\nideas? How was it implemented, and at what cost? Are we getting\
    \ closer\nto it? What is the promise? What is the threat?\n\nThere is equality\
    \ before God and equality here on earth. There is\nnatural equality and the kind\
    \ of equality that society creates. Some\npeople, incidentally, want to extend\
    \ equality to animals and plants as\nwell. There is equality of body and there\
    \ is equality of mind. There is\neconomic equality and there is equality before\
    \ the law. There is civic\nequality and there is political equality and there\
    \ is equality of\nopportunity and there is equality in front of death. There is\
    \ equality\namong individuals and there is equality among groups, nations, and\n\
    races. In Aldous Huxley’s celebrated book, *Brave New World*, this truth\nis held\
    \ to be self-evident that men are equal in respect to their\nphysico-chemical\
    \ makeups, but in no other way. The list is seemingly\nendless\n\n*Equality: The\
    \ Impossible Quest* considers all these problems and more.\nIt begins by considering\
    \ our primate relatives as well as various\nhistorical societies that never heard\
    \ of equality. Next, it traces the\ndevelopment of the idea and its implementation\
    \ in various societies\nthroughout history. This include ancient Greek equality\
    \ as realized in\nAthens and Sparta, monastic equality in both East and West,\
    \ social\nrevolts aimed at establishing equality, utopian equality, liberal\n\
    equality of the American and French Revolutionary varieties, socialist,\ncommunist\
    \ and kibbutz equalities, Nazi equality, the equality of women\nand minorities,\
    \ and biological equality through medical and genetic\nscience. The last chapter\
    \ deals with the greatest equalizer of all,\ndeath."

    ***On the Existence of Gods***


    Vox Day and Dominic Saltarelli


    Narrated by: Jon Mollison


    3 hours 22 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    *ON THE EXISTENCE OF GODS* is the response to a public challenge posed

    by a militant atheist who claimed to have never encountered any good

    arguments for the existence of gods. It is a competitive discourse

    between a Christian and an atheist, each of whom argue for their

    position on the subject, after which the arguments are adjudicated by a

    team of three judges, a Christian, an agnostic, and an atheist, before

    additional arguments are presented.


    The format is compelling and the results are at times surprising, as the

    discussion takes unexpected twists and turns, while the judges exhibit

    ruthless impartiality as they criticize the arguments without mercy or

    favor. Vox Day, the author of *THE IRRATIONAL ATHEIST*, presents the

    Christian perspective, while Dominic Saltarelli argues for the atheist

    position. The debate is wide-ranging and intelligent, but remains civil

    throughout, even as the momentum swings in favor of one side, and then

    the other.


    *ON THE EXISTENCE OF GODS* is a compelling test of how open the reader’s

    mind is to the various possibilities of reality, and is a worthy

    addition to the long history of Man’s contemplation of his own existence

    in the face of the divine.'

    ***Feed The Bear***


    Owen Benjamin


    Narrated by: Owen Benjamin


    Professional comedian Owen Benjamin explains the challenges of being

    funny. And not just being kind of funny, so funny that the 12-dollar

    drinks seem worth it. He analyzes the engineering aspects of the

    profession, and how there is a science of comedy beneath what appears on

    the surface to be effortless art.


    Feed the Big Bear by picking up a copy of *Feed the Bear*!


    *Feed the Bear* is the first book in the *Feed the Bear* series, which

    is about comedy and the engineering of comedy.


    Author Owen Benjamin is a professional comedian, an actor, and is

    featured daily on Unauthorized.TV. He has more than 250,000 subscribers

    on YouTube and is banned from so many humor-challenged social media

    platforms that he lost count.'

    **Four Generations of Modern War**


    William S. Lind


    Narrated by William S. Lind


    52 minutes


    Ebook included FREE!


    The Four Generations of Modern War is William S. Lind’s landmark lecture

    given at Quantico in 2000 that launched a continuing debate in many

    military circles. In this edited transcript of a later repetition of the

    original 50-minute lecture, Lind explains the conceptual framework of

    the Four Generations and goes briefly into detail describing the

    foundations and features of each of the Generations. He describes the

    gradual military transformation from Europe’s post-Westphalian culture

    of state order to the global culture of non-state disorder as well as

    the resulting effects of these transformations on the battlefield and

    beyond.


    From Westphalia and Waterloo to Oslo and Afghanistan, Lind provides

    informative historical examples of the Four Generation framework in

    action and explains its consequences for modern war. And in closing, he

    warns of how the development of Fourth Generation warfare may not favor

    the West in its ongoing, centuries-old clash with rival civilizations

    and cultures.'

    ***How To Be Poor***


    Milo Yiannopoulos


    65 pages


    Recently, I became poor.


    It’s disgusting, and it means God loves me less than he loves you. I

    know my tragic penury won’t last forever—but in case you, too, have been

    fired for something you said, deplatformed for something you believe, or

    just abruptly cut off from your trust fund, this book will explain how

    to navigate life when you are unexpectedly yanked from privilege and

    told to, err, earn a living.


    Pay close attention to the tips I’ve picked up, and you might just make

    it out alive—and with minimal split ends.


    Milo Yiannopoulos is an award-winning journalist, a *New York

    Times*-bestselling author, an international political celebrity, a free

    speech martyr, a comedian, an accomplished entrepreneur, a hair icon, a

    penitent and, to the annoyance of his many enemies, an exceedingly happy

    person. He is the most censored, most lied-about man in the world,

    banned from stepping foot on entire continents for his unapologetic

    commitment to free expression.'

    ***How To Be Straight***


    Milo Yiannopoulos


    65 pages


    Milo Yiannopoulos is not straight, but that’s never stopped him from

    handing out excellent advice. And let’s face it, heterosexuals need it.

    Milo has spent his entire life advocating for the most brutally

    repressed minority on the planet—straight people. In this book, the

    Grand Marshal of the Boston Straight Pride Parade explains what straight

    people are getting wrong in 21st-century America and how to keep your

    pecker up in a world that seems increasingly hostile to heteros. One

    day, says Milo—if the injunctions in this book are followed—straight

    people will be able to openly express pride in themselves without fear

    of judgement or hate, just like everyone else.


    In today’s America, few are brave enough to be openly heterosexual. For

    the rest of us, there’s HOW TO BE STRAIGHT.


    Milo Yiannopoulos is an award-winning journalist, a *New York

    \nVox Day\n\nNarrated by: Thomas Landon\n\nForward by: Milo Yiannopoulos\n\n7\
    \ hours 32 minutes\n\n*Ebook included free!*\n\nJordan Peterson is believed by\
    \ many to be the greatest thinker that\nhumanity has ever known. He is Father\
    \ Figure, Philosopher-King, and\nProphet to the millions of young men who are\
    \ his most fervent fans and\nfollowers. He is the central figure of the Intellectual\
    \ Dark Web, an\nacademic celebrity, and an unparalleled media phenomenon who has\n\
    shattered all conceptions of what it means to be modern celebrity in the\nInternet\
    \ Age.\n\nHe has, by his own admission, thought thoughts that no man has ever\n\
    thought before. He has dared to dream dreams that no man has ever\ndreamed before.\n\
    \nOf course, Jordan Peterson also happens to be a narcissist, a charlatan,\nand\
    \ an intellectual con man who doesn’t even bother to learn the\nsubjects upon\
    \ which he lectures. He is a defender of free speech who\nsilences other speakers,\
    \ a fearless free-thinker who never hesitates to\nrun away from debates, difficult\
    \ questions, and controversial issues, a\nphilosopher who rejects the conventional\
    \ definition of truth, and a\nlearned professor who has failed to read most of\
    \ the great classics of\nthe Western canon. He is, in short, a shameless and unrepentant\
    \ fraud\nwho lacks even a modicum of intellectual integrity.\n\nBut is Jordan\
    \ Peterson more than a mere fraud? Is he something more\nsinister, more unbalanced,\
    \ and even more dangerous? In *JORDANETICS: A\nJourney Into the Mind of Humanity’s\
    \ Greatest Thinker*, political\nphilosopher Vox Day delves deeply into the core\
    \ philosophy that Jordan\nPeterson advocates in both his written works and his\
    \ video lectures. In\ndoing so, Day methodically builds a shocking case that will\
    \ convince\neven the most skeptical Jordan Peterson supporter to reconsider both\
    \ the\nman and his teachings."

    ***Middle Rages: Why the Battle for Medieval Studies Matters to

    America***


    Milo Yiannopoulos


    96 pages


    Medieval Studies is the critical study of Europe’s self-identity. No

    understanding of Western civilization is possible without it.

    Inevitably, Left-wing academics want to introduce gender studies and

    race theory to the field—and punish those who refuse to conform. When

    one University of Chicago professor publicly celebrated the Christian

    identity of the Middle Ages, she was branded a ‘violent fascist’ and

    ‘white supremacist’ by her colleagues. Now Medieval Studies scholars are

    tearing their own discipline apart with witch-hunts, name-calling,

    boycotts and intimidation. The damage done to academia could be

    incalculable. In this influential essay, originally published to

    widespread online acclaim, New York Times-bestselling author and

    award-winning journalist Milo Yiannopoulos explains why we should all

    care about the newest front in the cultural war, the academic battle for

    the Middle Ages.


    Milo Yiannopoulos is an award-winning journalist, a *New York

    Times*-bestselling author, an international political celebrity, a free

    speech martyr, a comedian, an accomplished entrepreneur, a hair icon, a

    penitent and, to the annoyance of his many enemies, an exceedingly happy

    person. He is the most censored, most lied-about man in the world,

    banned from stepping foot on entire continents for his unapologetic

    commitment to free expression.'

    ***Mutiny in Space (The Thousand Worlds, Book One)***


    Rod Walker


    Narrated by: Wade Schoenemann


    5 hours 8 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    When the radical revolutionaries of the Social Party prevent his

    attendance at university and make his life on New Chicago impossible,

    Nikolai Rovio has no choice but to accept his starship-bound uncle’s

    offer to take refuge in space and sign on as a technical apprentice with

    Starways. But space, he quickly learns, is full of dangers that can kill

    a young man just as dead as even the most bloodthirsty revolutionary.


    And no place that Man can travel can ever truly serve as a safe refuge

    from ambitious and evil-minded men.


    Rod Walker is the New New Heinlein, and *MUTINY IN SPACE* marks a first

    step in the return of science fiction to its classical form and

    historical heights. Written in the style and tradition of Robert

    Heinlein’s 12 classic juvenile novels published by Scribner, Mutiny in

    Space is an exciting tale of space, technology, courage, independence,

    and the indomitable spirit of Man.'

    -----------


    For more than 200 years, the question of free trade has been considered

    settled by economists. However, advancements in technology have

    considerably changed the world since David Ricardo popularized the

    concept of Comparative Advantage in the early 19th century, and the rise

    of economic populism around the world is increasingly calling long-held

    assumptions into question.


    ***On the Question of Free Trade: An Economics Discourse ***is a public

    debate between Dr. James D. Miller, Associate Professor of Economics at

    Smith College, and Vox Day, the author of *The Return of the Great

    Depression*, in which they address the vital question of whether free

    trade is intrinsically beneficial or detrimental to a national economy.

    Both participants are well-versed in economic history and economic

    theory, which permits them to bypass the political side issues that so

    often cloud such debates and focus on the core issues involved. The

    post-debate Q&A session is also included.


    ***On the Question of Free Trade*** is an informative and

    thought-provoking discourse that will provide material for serious

    contemplation regardless of the reader’s perspective on economics and

    free trade.'

    ***On War: The Collected Columns of William S. Lind 2003-2009***


    William S. Lind


    26 hours, 44 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    *On War* is a seven-year collection of columns written by the father of

    4th Generation War theory while observing the U.S. invasion and

    subsequent occupation of Iraq. It is an intriguing account of a war in

    progress, as seen through the eyes of a military theorist able to

    anticipate events with an almost prophetic degree of accuracy.

    Throughout the book, 4GW theory is defined, described, and refined as

    events in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places demonstrate the theory’s

    utility in making sense of current events and predicting future ones.

    The inevitable failure of the New Iraqi Army and the U.S.-installed

    al-Maliki government is explained years in advance, as is the rise of

    the Islamic State and other 4th Generation forces presently battling for

    power in post-occupation Iraq.


    Lind also makes an ominous, but compelling case for the gradual spread

    of 4th Generation chaos and the decline of the state throughout the

    world, including in the United States of America. Featuring a Foreword

    by the brilliant Israeli military theorist Martin van Creveld, *On War*

    is a fascinating book that is a must-read for every military

    professional, wargamer, and amateur student of the art of war.


    In one of the key passages of the book, Lind writes: “4th Generation war

    is the greatest change since the Peace of Westphalia, because it marks

    the end of the state’s monopoly on war. All over the world, state

    militaries are fighting non-state opponents, and almost always, the

    state is losing.”


    William S. Lind is one of the most significant and influential military

    theorists on the planet. The author of the *Maneuver Warfare Handbook*

    and a founder of 4th Generation War theory, Mr. Lind is known and

    respected by military personnel around the world.'

    apparent of an alien royal house are discovered on the streets of Trans

    be found, but if it is the criminals or the crime investigators who will

    contribute more to the final body count. DRM-free.

    ***QUANTUM MORTIS A Mind Programmed***


    Vox Day, Jeff Sutton, and Jean Sutton


    210 pages


    Centuries before Chief Warrant Officer Graven Tower joined MCID, the

    Greater Terran Ascendancy found itself facing a historic crisis when the

    Shiva-class cruiser ATSV Rigel went missing during a routine patrol

    through the Kantillon sector. Fortunately for the great star-spanning

    Terran empire, the Ascendancy Intelligence Directorate’s top operative,

    Daniela York is on the scene. And with the shadow of galactic war

    looming, is she capable of penetrating the lethal plot being executed by

    House Dai Zhan’s ruthless assassins, especially after the Directorate

    discovers that the cyborgs of the Man-Machine Integration may be

    involved?


    *QUANTUM MORTIS A Mind Programmed* is a tightly plotted, intense spy

    thriller that lays the deep historical foundation for the futuristic

    science fiction world of Quantum Mortis. A masterful literary remix of a

    true SF classic.'

    ***QUANTUM MORTIS: Gravity Kills***


    Steve Rzasa & Vox Day


    55 pages


    The independent planet of Rhysalan provides Sanctuary to 1,462

    governments-in-exile. It is the responsibility of the Xenocriminology

    and Alien Relations department of the Military Crimes Investigation

    Division to keep a firm leash on the hundreds of thousands of xenos

    residing on-planet. Assassinations, revolutions, civil wars, and

    attempted planetary genocides are all in a day’s work for warrant

    officer Graven Tower, MCID-XAR.


    When an alien ambassador is found dead in orbit while returning to his

    home planet accompanied by a company of mercenaries from Wardogs

    Incorporated, suspicions are naturally aroused. But uncovering the truth

    isn’t deemed to be in the interest of the planetary administration,

    which would just as soon pretend the ambassador’s death was an accident.

    And when Chief Warrant Officer Graven Tower arrives at the scene of the

    crime, another question is soon raised: are MCID’s dynamic investigation

    methods truly compatible with thinly armored spaceship hulls?'

    HORSE* covers everything from real-world lasers, intelligence ops,

    threat assessments, and wargame design to space combats, fleet actions,

    \ He learned that primitive societies are very\ndifferent from our modern industrialised\

    \ work.\n\nBut since all Man’s ancestors used to live in a similar manner,\nunderstanding\
    \ these societies is essential to understanding the human\nrace itself, especially\

    ***SJWs Always Lie: Taking Down the Thought Police***


    Vox Day


    Narrated by: Bob Allen


    Forward by: Milo Yiannopoulos


    6 hours 48 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    Social Justice Warriors have plagued mankind for more than 150 years,

    but only in the last 30 years has their ideology become dominant in the

    West. Having invaded one institution of the cultural high ground after

    another, from corporations and churches to video games and government,

    there is nowhere that remains entirely free of their intolerant thought

    and speech policing.


    Because the SJW agenda of diversity, tolerance, inclusiveness, and

    equality flies in the face of both science and observable reality, SJWs

    relentlessly work to prevent normal people from thinking or speaking in

    any manner that will violate their ever-mutating Narrative. They police

    science, philosophy, technology, and even history in order to maintain

    the pretense that their agenda remains inevitable in a modern world that

    contradicts it on a daily basis.


    The book is named after the First Law of SJW: SJWs always lie. SJWS

    ALWAYS LIE is a useful guide to understanding, anticipating, and

    surviving SJW attacks from the perspective of a man who has not only

    survived, but thrived, after experiencing multiple attempts by Social

    Justice Warriors to disqualify, discredit, and disemploy him in the same

    manner they have successfully attacked Nobel Laureates, technology CEOs,

    broadcasters, sports commentators, school principals, and policemen. It

    analyzes well-known SJW attacks as well as the two most successful

    examples of resistance to the SJW Narrative, \#GamerGate and Sad

    Puppies.


    Written by Vox Day, Supreme Dark Lord of the Evil Legion of Evil and

    three-time Hugo nominee who is described as the most hated man in

    science fiction by Black Gate and The Wall Street Journal, SJWS ALWAYS

    LIE is a powerful weapon in the cultural war against the thought police.'

    ***SJWs Always Double Down: Anticipating the Thought Police***


    Vox Day


    Narrated by: Bob Allen


    Forward by: Ivan Throne


    6 hours 34 minutes


    *Ebook included free!*


    Whether you realize it or not, if you live in the West, you are

    currently engulfed in a civilization-wide cultural war that is taking

    place all around you. Maybe you’re aware of it, or maybe you’re not. It

    doesn’t matter. The cultural war is real and it is vicious. And unlike a

    traditional shooting war between different nations, in a cultural war

    there are no civilians. There are no neutral parties, since no

    fence-sitting is permitted, and there is no common ground to be found.

    No one is permitted to sit it out or refuse to take sides; sooner or

    later, you are going to be forced to declare yourself by either publicly

    submitting to the SJW Narrative or openly rejecting it.


    No matter what you do, no matter who you are, and no matter who you

    know, the SJWs will come after you once they believe you pose a threat

    to their Narrative, or to their objectives for the organization they are

    attempting to converge.


    The book is named after the Second Law of SJW: **SJWs always double

    down**. *SJWS ALWAYS DOUBLE DOWN* is a much-needed guide to

    understanding, anticipating, and surviving SJW attacks from the

    perspective of a man who has not only survived, but thrived, after

    experiencing multiple attempts by Social Justice Warriors to disqualify,

    discredit, and disemploy him in the same manner they have successfully

    attacked Nobel Laureates, technology CEOs, broadcasters, sports

    commentators, school principals, open source programmers, and policemen.


    Written by Vox Day, Supreme Dark Lord of the Evil Legion of Evil and

    bestselling political philosopher, and featuring a foreword by Ivan

    Throne, *SJWS ALWAYS DOUBLE DOWN* is a vital weapon in the cultural war

    against the thought police.'

    \ which the realm of man is\ndominated by a rich and powerful Church, the Sanctified\
    \ Father Charity\nIV has decided the time is ripe to make a conclusive inquiry\

    Vox Day


    Narrated by Jeremy Daw


    7 hours and 13 minutes


    *Ebooks included FREE!*


    *The Last Witchking & Other Storie*s consists of five stories set in the

    epic fantasy world of A THRONE OF BONES. The title story concerns the

    hidden heir to a fallen race of magicians, who learns his father’s dark

    lore as he pursues vengeance against those who destroyed his people. The

    second story, “The Hoblets of Wiccam Fensboro”, is a tale of survival

    and the triumph of simple human decency in the face of brutality and

    defeat. The third story, the Hugo-nominated “Opera Vita Aeterna”, tells

    the story of an elven sorcerer and a religious monk, and how they

    discover that the power of friendship can be the highest and most potent

    magic of all.


    The audiobook also contains “The Wardog’s Coin” and “Qalabi Dawn”.

    \ science, political\neconomy, and well-documented research. The arguments of\
    \ Richard Dawkins,\nSam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, and Michel\
    \ Onfray are\nall methodically exposed and discredited as Day provides extensive\n\
    evidence proving, among other things, that:\n\n-   More than 93 percent of all\
    \ the wars in human history had no\n    relation to religion\n-   The Spanish\
    \ Inquisition had no jurisdiction over professing Jews,\n    Muslims, or atheists,\
    \ and executed fewer people on an annual basis\n    than the state of Texas\n\
    -   Atheists are almost four times more likely to be imprisoned than\n    Christians\n\
    -   “Red” state crime primarily takes place in “blue” counties\n-   Sexually abused\
    \ girls are 55 times more likely to commit suicide\n    than girls raised Catholic\n\
    -   In the twentieth century, atheistic regimes killed three times more\n    people\
    \ in peacetime than those killed in all the wars and individual\n    crimes combined.\n\
    \n*The Irrational Atheist* provides the rational thinker with conclusive\nempirical\
    \ proof that atheism’s claims against religion are completely\nunfounded in logic,\

    original nine-volume series, which ran from 1982 to 1990, including

    Robert Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip K. Dick, Gordon Dickson, Poul

    Anderson, John Brunner, Gregory Benford, Robert Silverberg, Harry

    Turtledove, and Ben Bova.


    33 years later, Castalia House joined forces with Dr. Jerry Pournelle in

    order to make this classic science fiction series available to the

    public again. *THERE WILL BE WAR* is a treasure trove of science fiction

    and history that will educate and amaze new readers while reminding old

    ones how much the world has changed over the last three decades. Most of

    the stories, like war itself, remain entirely relevant today.


    *THERE WILL BE WAR Volume X* is edited by Jerry Pournelle and features

    18 stories, articles, and poems. Of particular note are “Battle Station”

    by Ben Bova, “Flashpoint: Titan” by Cheah Kai Wai, “What Price

    Humanity?” by David VanDyke, and the eerily prescient “The Man Who

    Wasn’t There” by Gregory Benford. Volume X also includes timely essays

    on “War and Migration” by Martin van Creveld, “The 4GW Counterforce” by

    William S. Lind and LtCol Gregory A. Thiele, USMC, and “The Deadly

    Future of Littoral Sea Control” by CDR Phillip E. Pournelle, USN, which

    was awarded the 2015 Literary Award by the Surface Navy Association for

    “the best professional article in any publication addressing Surface

    Navy or surface warfare issues.”'

    ***Wardogs Inc. \#1: Battlesuit Bastards***


    G.D. Stark


    Narrated by: Jon Mollison


    All war is murder for profit. Some corporations are just more honest

    about it.


    WARDOGS INCORPORATED is one of the largest and most professional

    mercenary corporations operating in the Kantillon subsector. If you need

    a bodyguard, an assassination team, or an armored cavalry regiment

    complete with air support, Wardogs Inc. can provide it for you… for a

    very steep price.


    Tommy Falkland is proud to be a Wardog. And he’s delighted when WDI’s

    executives sign a massive contract to arrange for a little regime change

    on a no-account low-tech planet that looks like a highly profitable

    cakewalk. But when the interstellar transportation company contracted to

    deliver their equipment unexpectedly fails to deliver their armor and

    artillery dirtside, Tommy and his fellow Wardogs find themselves caught

    in the middle of the killing zone.


    And there they learn that bullets will kill a man dead just as quickly

    as a plasma bolt.


    Set in the science fiction universe of Quantum Mortis, BATTLESUIT

    BASTARDS is the first in the WARDOGS INC. series of military science

    fiction novels.'

    Fresh from the nuclear-scarred battlefields of Ulixis, Tommy Falkland

    and his squad mates are happy to be assigned to a simple corporate

    bodyguard contract when the interstellar corporation Datacon Verlag

    inadvertently offends a seriously strange religious cult with an

    advertising campaign and turns to Wardogs Incorporated for protection.

    But the contract proves to be considerably more challenging than

    expected when the executive they are guarding ends up dead, murdered by

    a military-grade toxin, and they find themselves ordered to track down

    his killer. But how do you solve a murder when your two primary skills

    are breaking things and killing people?

    *All war is murder for profit. Some corporations are just more honest

    about it.*


    WARDOGS INCORPORATED is one of the largest and most professional

    mercenary corporations operating in the Kantillon subsector. If you need

    a bodyguard, an assassination team, or an armored cavalry regiment

    complete with air support, Wardogs Inc. can provide it for you… for a

    very steep price.


    The Stratocracy of Sfodria has ruled over its people with a very large

    steel fist for centuries. The giant mechs piloted by their nobles are

    all but invulnerable and have long served as the aristocratic shield

    against Sfodria’s enemies. But recently, their indestructible knights

    have been falling in battle at an unprecedented rate, and no one knows

    why. Desperate to reverse the fortunes of war before their nation falls

    to their hereditary enemy, the Stratocracy turns to Wardogs Incorporated

    to train their ineffective and long-ignored militia.


    Tommy Falkland and his fellow Wardogs aren’t on the job long before they

    begin to realize that they may be in well over their pay grade, as it

    rapidly becomes clear they are not dealing with an ordinary human

    threat.


    Set in the science fiction universe of Quantum Mortis, METAL MONSTERS is

    the third in the WARDOGS INC. series of military science fiction novels.'

    ***Young Man’s War (The Thousand Worlds)***


    Rod Walker


    153 pages


    When the Dark Gates open and unleash the monstrous Darksiders on an

    unsuspecting Earth, only the toughest and most determined people will

    survive. Roland and Maggie Kane are more fortunate than most, because

    their father, Daniel, is a Chicago cop who has taught them how to shoot

    and prepared them for almost every eventuality. But, as the Kane family

    soon learns, there is just no way to prepare for an alien invasion.


    However, Roland also discovers that although the Darksiders’ blood may

    be green, the invaders will die as readily as any man after being

    ventilated with enough high-speed projectiles.


    Rod Walker is the New New Heinlein, and The Thousand Worlds marks the

    return of science fiction to its classical form and historical heights.

    Written in the style and tradition of Robert Heinlein’s 12 classic

    juvenile novels published by Scribner, YOUNG MAN’S WAR is an exciting

    tale of survival, courage, independence, and the indomitable spirit of

    Man.'
