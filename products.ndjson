Lind***\n\nMartin van Creveld\n\n144 pages\n\n“Martin van Creveld ranks high among military historians, and given the\nchanges in technology since Napoleonic times, his work is a necessary\nsupplement to Clausewitz.”\n\n– Dr. Jerry Pournelle\n\n*The Art of War* by Sun Tzu and *On War* by Carl von Clausewitz are\nknown to everyone who studies war. But in the approximately 2,327 years\nthat separated Man’s two most famous works of military tactics and\nstrategy, a considerable number of less well-known works were published.\nSome, such as those written by Vauban and Douhet, were focused on\nspecific aspects of war, while others like Onasander and Jomini wrote\nworks that were more general in nature. But all of them were written\nwith the objective of permitting generals and other leaders of men to\nwage war more effectively.\n\nThere are few better suited to write the history of strategy and\nmilitary thought than Dr. Martin van Creveld, who has himself been a\nsignificant contributor to the literature of war. A Professor Emeritus\nat the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Dr. van Creveld is one of the\nworld’s leading writers on military history and strategy, with a special\ninterest in the future of war. He is fluent in Hebrew, German, Dutch,\nand English, and has authored more than twenty books, including the\ninfluential *Technology and War: 2000 BC to the Present* (1988), *The\nTransformation of War* (1991), and *The Culture of War* (2010). He is\nknown for his development of the concept of “nontrinitarian” warfare as\nwell as contributing two books to the 4GW canon.\n\nFeaturing a foreword by Dr. Jerry Pournelle, *A History of Strategy:\nFrom Sun Tzu to William S. Lind* begins with the Chinese military\nliterature, then reviews the Greek, Roman and Byzantine works before\nproceeding to the Middle Ages. From Machiavelli and Montecuccoli to\nGuibert and Frederick the Great, van Creveld chronicles the gradual\ntransition from medieval to Napoleonic warfare. Subsequent chapters\ndelve into the literature of naval warfare, including Mahan and Corbett,\nthen examine the works of the leading strategists of the early 20th\ncentury, including Moltke, Liddell Hart, and Ludendorff. The final\nchapter considers the modern strategists behind such concepts as\nMutually Assured Destruction, terrorism, insurgency, and 4th Generation\nWar.\n\nThis brief, but wide-ranging history is an effective education in\nmilitary thought. It is an excellent introduction to the various\nstrategic works for the neophyte, and an illuminating summary of them\nfor armchair and professional experts alike. Van Creveld not only\ndescribes each thinker and his most important contributions, but\nexplains how one conceptual advancement led to another, and in doing so,\nmakes it eminently clear why Sun Tzu and Clausewitz are so universally\nwell-regarded by theoreticians and practitioners of war alike."}

Nobody has done more to spread this view than the\nFrench economic historian Thomas Piketty, whose best-selling volume,\nCapital in the Twentieth Century, not only documents the process but\nrepresents one long call for reducing the gaps so as to create a more\nequal society. But what is equality? Who invented the idea, when, where,\nand why? How did it develop, grow, mature, and interact with other\nideas? How was it implemented, and at what cost? Are we getting closer\nto it? What is the promise? What is the threat?\n\nThere is equality before God and equality here on earth. There is\nnatural equality and the kind of equality that society creates. Some\npeople, incidentally, want to extend equality to animals and plants as\nwell. There is equality of body and there is equality of mind. There is\neconomic equality and there is equality before the law. There is civic\nequality and there is political equality and there is equality of\nopportunity and there is equality in front of death. There is equality\namong individuals and there is equality among groups, nations, and\nraces. In Aldous Huxley’s celebrated book, *Brave New World*, this truth\nis held to be self-evident that men are equal in respect to their\nphysico-chemical makeups, but in no other way. The list is seemingly\nendless\n\n*Equality: The Impossible Quest* considers all these problems and more.\nIt begins by considering our primate relatives as well as various\nhistorical societies that never heard of equality. Next, it traces the\ndevelopment of the idea and its implementation in various societies\nthroughout history. This include ancient Greek equality as realized in\nAthens and Sparta, monastic equality in both East and West, social\nrevolts aimed at establishing equality, utopian equality, liberal\nequality of the American and French Revolutionary varieties, socialist,\ncommunist and kibbutz equalities, Nazi equality, the equality of women\nand minorities, and biological equality through medical and genetic\nscience. The last chapter deals with the greatest equalizer of all,\ndeath."}

No\nunderstanding of Western civilization is possible without it.\nInevitably, Left-wing academics want to introduce gender studies and\nrace theory to the field—and punish those who refuse to conform.

Now Medieval Studies scholars are\ntearing their own discipline apart with witch-hunts, name-calling,\nboycotts and intimidation. The damage done to academia could be\nincalculable. In this influential essay, originally published to\nwidespread online acclaim, New York Times-bestselling author and\naward-winning journalist Milo Yiannopoulos explains why we should all\ncare about the newest front in the cultural war, the academic battle for\nthe Middle Ages.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos is an award-winning journalist, a *New York\nTimes*-bestselling author, an international political celebrity, a free\nspeech martyr, a comedian, an accomplished entrepreneur, a hair icon, a\npenitent and, to the annoyance of his many enemies, an exceedingly happy\nperson.

He learned that primitive societies are very\ndifferent from our modern industrialised societies and that it takes a\nconsiderable amount study to understand how they work.\n\nBut since all Man’s ancestors used to live in a similar manner,\nunderstanding these societies is essential to understanding the human\nrace itself, especially when speculating about our prehistoric ancestors\nin East Africa. Unfortunately a wide variety of journalists and science\nwriters, historians, linguists, biologists, and especially evolutionary\npsychologists erroneously believe they are qualified to write about\nprimitive societies without knowing much about them.\n\nThe result is that many of their superficial speculations have about as\nmuch scientific credibility as *The Flintstones*. The various critical\nstudies contained in ***Ship of Fools: An Anthology of Learned Nonsense\nabout Primitive Society*** examine some of the most popular of these\nspeculations and evaluate their scientific merit.\n\nAmong the learned fools whose works are critiqued are:\n\nYuval Harari’s *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*  \nEmma Byrne’s *Swearing is Good For You*  \nRené Girard’s theory of learned behavior  \nWilliam Arens’s *The Man-Eating Myth*  \nNoam Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar"}

In a fantasy world in which the realm of man is\ndominated by a rich and powerful Church, the Sanctified Father Charity\nIV has decided the time is ripe to make a conclusive inquiry into the\nmatter. If, in his infallible wisdom, he determines that elves do have\nimmortal souls, then the Church will be obliged to bring the Sacred Word\nof the Immaculate to them. But if he decides they do not, there will be\nholy war. Powerful factions line up on both sides of the debate.\nWar-hungry magnates cast greedy eyes at the ancient wealth of the elven\nkingdoms and pray for a declaration that elves are little more than\nanimals. And there are men who are willing to do more than merely pray.\nThe delegation sent to the High King of the Elves is led by two great\ntheologians, brilliant philosophers who champion opposite sides of the\ngreat debate. And in the Sanctiff’s own stead, he sends the young\nnobleman, Marcus Valerius. Marcus Valerius is a rising scholar in the\nChurch, talented, fearless, and devout. But he is inexperienced in the\nways of the world and nothing in his life has prepared him for the\nbeauty of the elves–or the monumental betrayal into which he rides.\n\nSUMMA ELVETICA is the prelude to the massive epic high fantasy saga ARTS\nOF DARK AND LIGHT. It contains eight additional tales of Selenoth,\nincluding *A Magic Broken*, *Master of Cats*, *The Wardog’s Coin*, *The\nLast Witchking*, and the Hugo Award finalist for best novelette, *Opera\nVita Aeterna*."}

Yet, somehow, their enemy\nis even worse.”**  \n— ANN COULTER\n\n**“A chilling story of judicial malpractice and Orwellian prosecutorial\noverreach.”**  \n— MICHELLE MALKIN\n\n**“More than just the trial of Roger Stone, it’s the trial of America’s\nbasic liberties. An incredible tour de force.”**  \n— ALEX JONES\n\nThe Mueller Report was a catastrophe for the malevolent forces desperate\nto impeach President Donald Trump. It failed to prove any collusion\nbetween the Trump campaign and Russia. Since then, many of the\nPresident’s former advisors and associates have been subjected to\nvindictive, political prosecutions for a variety of trivial, unrelated\noffenses. Roger Stone is one of them.\n\nIn this moving, eyewitness account of Stone’s trial and his decades-long\ncareer of political chicanery, author and Stone intimate Milo\nYiannopoulos introduces America to the man behind the myth–and explains\nhow the biggest stitch-up in modern judicial history unfolded. He offers\na plea to President Trump to step in and do the right thing, and\nfinally, he explains how we can prevent such grotesque injustices from\nhappening ever again.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos is a *New York Times*-bestselling author, an\naward-winning investigative reporter, a globally-recognized free speech\nicon and by common consent the most censored, most lied-about man in the\nworld, banned from stepping foot on entire continents for his\nunapologetic commitment to free expression. His first book, Dangerous,\nsold over 200,000 copies, despite never being reviewed in any major\npublication.\n\n*This Digital Edition includes both EPUB and Kindle formats.*"}

On the other is Irrational Atheist author Vox Day, armed\nwith nothing more than historical and statistical facts. Presenting a\ncompelling argument (but not for the side one might expect), Day strips\naway the pseudo-scientific pretentions of New Atheism with his\nintelligent application of logic, history, military science, political\neconomy, and well-documented research. The arguments of Richard Dawkins,\nSam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, and Michel Onfray are\nall methodically exposed and discredited as Day provides extensive\nevidence proving, among other things, that:\n\n-   More than 93 percent of all the wars in human history had no\n    relation to religion\n-   The Spanish Inquisition had no jurisdiction over professing Jews,\n    Muslims, or atheists, and executed fewer people on an annual basis\n    than the state of Texas\n-   Atheists are almost four times more likely to be imprisoned than\n    Christians\n-   “Red” state crime primarily takes place in “blue” counties\n-   Sexually abused girls are 55 times more likely to commit suicide\n    than girls raised Catholic\n-   In the twentieth century, atheistic regimes killed three times more\n    people in peacetime than those killed in all the wars and individual\n    crimes combined.\n\n*The Irrational Atheist* provides the rational thinker with conclusive\nempirical proof that atheism’s claims against religion are completely\nunfounded in logic, fact, science, and history."}
